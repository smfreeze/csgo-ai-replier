# csgo-oogabooga-chatbot

# DOES NOT WORK IN CS2 - as they removed, admittedly outdated, functions that makes this possible.

A very simple, free, locally-run CS:GO chatbot that replies to messages in chat for you.


Uses the (locally-run) oogabooga web ui for running LLMs and NOT ChatGPT (completely free, not chatgpt API key needed)


As you are self-hosting the LLMs (that unsuprisingly use your GPU) you may see a performance decrease in CS:GO (although, this should be minor as CS:GO is very CPU oriented).


You COULD host the LLMs on another device (w/GPU) and use the oogabooga public api feature to play without performance changes.


Oogabooga also offers a CPU mode but this would likely lead to a much worse performance in CS:GO.


It will automatically reply to every enemy/teammate message, but you can talk to it using the 'prompt: (your prompt)' function.


Example Conversation:
```
Player: You suck!
AI: Like your mother
Player: You are actually the worst.
AI: Your aim is the worst.
```

Obviously, the response would change with the model and your character description, it is very programmable, even with very little experience with oogabooga/gradio interface.


## Use
Complete the setup correctly and run the program.


In a CS:GO game type 'OogaMenu' in chat to get the menu chat interface, enable and disable what you want.


## Future
Currently working on updating this with CS2 support.

Also, this is a bit outdated, working on some stuff.

# Setup
## Program setup
cd into where you want to install it and then:
```
git clone https://github.com/smfreeze/csgo-oogabooga-chatbot.git
cd csgo-oogabooga-chatbot
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Make appropriate changes to Program.py in the config section


## Oogabooga setup
(Thanks [DeSinc](https://github.com/DeSinc/SallyBot) for some data regarding this Oogabooga setup guide)
<br><br>
Warning: For the average 7B model, it requires a card with at least 6GB of VRAM.

Download and install [Oobabooga from their repo here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui). Information on how to install in README, but basically just use 1-click installer.

After downloading and unzipping the 1-click installer, run `start_windows.bat`. The installer is interactive and you will need to enter your GPU device when prompted (could use CPU mode but not recommended, especially for the CPU oriented CS:GO)

The install script should then give you a web address to the web ui after installing requirements, go to the model section. Install a model (look on HugginFace), copy the model name and paste into model download section (many tutorials of this exist)

After the installing has finished you need to set up the arguements in the `webui.py` file to allow the script to communicate with Oobabooga. It can be found near the top of the file.

![Showing where to input args](https://github.com/DeSinc/SallyBot/assets/36467674/a7c6e8b0-6644-4c73-878b-9b2cb44c1d3a)

Arguments to be added here include:

`--chat` sets the web interface to chat mode which is better. This arg isn't necessary it just makes the web interface look nicer if you choose to browse to it on localhost:7862 in your web browser.

`--model <folder_name_of_model>` specifies which model Oobabooga should use, replace `<folder_name_of_model>` it is the name of the folder in text-generation-webui/models.

`--api` tells Oobabooga to allow the program to integrate together.

`--loader exllama_hf` uses the much updated ExLLAMA model loader which is literally nearly 2x faster than the previously used loader. Might already be default by the time you see and run this.

`--listen-port 7862` is set to 7862 to not overlap with stable diffusion. `--api` opens a separate port for the program to interface with which runs on port 5000. Port 7862 is still used to view the web interface.

`--xformers` is a very good optimiser that reduces your vram usage for free. This argument is not required but very encouraged. It needs to be installed into Oobabooga to use. Run `cmd_windows.bat` and type `pip install xformers`, when it is done you can type exit.

`--wbits 4` and `--groupsize 128` specify details about the model. If you know what you're doing you can remove whichever ones you don't need. `--groupsize 128` if you are using a non 128 groupsize model, or `--wbits 4` if you are not running a 4-bit quantized model, for instance. Most of the consumer running ones are 4bit quantized to run on normal amounts of vram, so you'll need this arg to run those models.

Example of args:
`'--model TheBloke_Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML --chat --listen-port 7862 --api'`

If you'd like to modify the parameters for Oobabooga, it's this section here:
```py
request = {
        'user_input': user_input,
        'max_new_tokens': 750,
        'auto_max_new_tokens': False,
        'history': history,
        'mode': 'chat',
        'character': character, # Change/add this in the oogabooga api (chat settings -> character)
        'instruction_template': 'Vicuna-v1.1', 
        'your_name': 'You',
        'regenerate': False,
        '_continue': False,
        'stop_at_newline': False,
        'chat_generation_attempts': 1,
        'chat-instruct_command': 'Continue the chat dialogue below. Write a single reply for the character "<|Character|>".\n\n<|Prompt|>',
    }
```
(From OogaAPI.py in the getResponse() function)
